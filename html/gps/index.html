  HTML5 semantic tags group content in meaningful ways.  main, nav and footer are likely to be used in virtually every page.

  Top to bottom, left to right.
* What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  Snippets will come in handy when I find myself typing something over and over again.
* What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  I found the challenge instructions to be the most difficult thing to understand.  They were sometimes contractory and unclear, which led to unnecessary confusion and wasted time that did not benefit my learning.

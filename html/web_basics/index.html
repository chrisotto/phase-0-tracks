    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>This is a <strong>Web page</strong>.  I want to <em>emphasize</em> this point.  I would also like to follow this point with a couple of others:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A second point</li>
      <li>A first point</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or I suppose that should be:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A first point</li>
      <li>A second point</li>
    </ol>

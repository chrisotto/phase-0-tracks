1. Try to find an overview of what JQuery is, what it's good for and how it works.
    * Read an overview or two (Wikipedia?)
    * Watch a intro tutorial to get a feel for it
2. Find a couple of basic things that it does and try to do them
3. Pick one or two things that it's supposed to be good for and try to use it for that

* Reviewing examples on W3Schools was most useful, as it gave an overview of calls available with code examples that I could play with.
* The video tutorial was helpful, as it approached the topic from a different perspective, namely the things most likely to be useful / encountered.

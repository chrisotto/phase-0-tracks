# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
** Version control enables saving the current state of code so that one can identify what changes are made, by who and when.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
** A branch is a copy of the "master" code where one can make changes without impacting the master code until ready.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
** A commit is a formal set of changes that are applied to the code (master or branch).  A good commit message clearly and explicitly summarizes the changes made.
* What is a merge conflict?
** A merge conflict occurs when code to be merged from a branch will change a file that has already changed since the branch was checked out.  Most often, this happens when many people are working on the same code repository.
